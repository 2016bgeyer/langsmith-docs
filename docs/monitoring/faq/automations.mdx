# How to apply automations

While it is useful to look at all datapoints by hand, it can be useful to create automations that automatically take action upon a filtered subset of datapoints.
Automations are defined by a filter and an action

## How to create a filter

You can create a filter by doing what you normally would to filter traces. When you then click on `Rules`, an automation is created with that specified filter.

## How to specify a sampling rate

You can specify a sampling rate (between 0 and 1) for automations. This will control the percent of the filtered runs that are sent to an automation

## How to manage automations

You can manage automations by going `Settings` -> `Rules`. From here you can view all automations you already created, you can edit them, and you can delete them.
You can also create new automations, although it is generally recommended you create automations from the `Traces` panel in a Project, so that you can see the filter you apply.
