# Concepts

In this guide we will go over some of the concepts that are important to understand when thinking about production logging and automations in LangSmith.
A lot of these concepts build off of tracing concepts - it is recommended to read the [Tracing Concepts](/tracing/concepts) documentation before.

## Runs
A `Run` is a span representing a single unit of work or operation within your LLM application. This could be anything from single call to an LLM or chain, to a prompt formatting call, to a runnable lambda invocation. If you are familiar with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), you can think of a run as a span.


## Traces
A `Trace` is a collection of runs that are related to a single operation. For example, if you have a user request that triggers a chain, and that chain makes a call to an LLM, then to an output parser, and so on, all of these runs would be part of the same trace. If you are familiar with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), you can think of a LangSmith trace as a collection of spans. Runs are bound to a trace by a unique trace ID.

## Filter
A `Filter` is a rule that applies to all runs in a project. The default filter you see on the main page selects only top-level runs (`IsRoot` is `true`) but you can filter for sub-runs as well.

## Threads

A `Thread` is a sequence of traces representing a conversation. Each response is represented as it's own trace, but these traces are linked together by being part of the same conversation.

You can track threads by attaching a special metadata key to runs (one of `session_id`, `thread_id` or `conversation_id`).

## Monitoring Dashboard

Monitoring dashboards display key metrics over time for a configurable time window. We track LLM related statistics like latency, feedback, time-to-first-token, cost, and more. You can see these dashboard by going to the `Monitors` tab.

## Rules

Rules represent actions that are taken on a set of runs. These are configured by a filter rule and an action.

## Datasets

Datasets are a way to collect datapoints. For more information, see [here](/evaluation/concepts)

## Annotation Queues

Annotation Queues are a user friendly way to annotate a lot of traces.

## Online Evaluation

Online evaluation is when an LLM is used to assign feedback to particular runs.
