# TypeScript Setup

This guide will continue from the hub quickstart, using the TypeScript SDK to interact with the hub instead of the Playground UI.

This guide assumes you've gone through the Hub [Quick Start](./quickstart) including login-required steps.

If you don't yet have an account, you'll only be able to pull public objects in steps 1 and 3.

## 1. Install/upgrade packages

**Note:** You likely need to upgrade even if they're already installed!

```bash
yarn add langchain langchainhub 
```

## 2. Configuring environment variables

Get an API key for your **personal** organization if you have not yet. The hub will not work with your non-personal organization's api key!

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_KEY="ls_..."
```

## 3. Pull an object from the hub and use it

```ts
// import
import * as hub from "langchain/hub";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

// pull a chat prompt
const prompt = await hub.pull("efriis/my-first-prompt");

// create a model to use it with
const model = new ChatOpenAI();

// use it in a runnable
const runnable = prompt.pipe(model);
const result = await runnable.invoke({
	"profession": "biologist",
	"question": "What is special about parrots?",
});

console.log(result);
```

## 4. Push it back to your personal organization as a private prompt

For this step, you'll need the `handle` for your account!

```ts
import * as hub from "langchain/hub";

await hub.push("<handle>/my-first-prompt", prompt);
```
