# Python Setup

This guide will continue from the hub quickstart, using the Python SDK to interact with the hub instead of the Playground UI.

This guide assumes you've gone through the Hub [Quick Start](./quickstart) including login-required steps.

If you don't yet have an account, you'll only be able to pull public objects in steps 1 and 3.

## 1. Install/upgrade packages

**Note:** You likely need to upgrade even if they're already installed!

```bash
pip install --upgrade langchain langchainhub 
```

## 2. Configuring environment variables

Get an API key for your **Personal** organization if you have not yet. The hub will not work with your non-personal organization's api key!

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_KEY="ls_..."
```

## 3. Pull an object from the hub and use it

```python
from langchain import hub

# pull a chat prompt
prompt = hub.pull("efriis/my-first-prompt")

# create a model to use it with
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
model = ChatOpenAI()

# use it in a runnable
runnable = prompt | model
runnable.invoke({
	"profession": "biologist",
	"question": "What is special about parrots?",
})
```

## 4. Push it back to your personal organization as a private prompt

For this step, you'll need the `handle` for your account!

```python
from langchain import hub

hub.push("<handle>/my-first-prompt", prompt)
```
