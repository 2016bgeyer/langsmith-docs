# Export Runs Locally

Running local analysis of your run data can be incredibly useful at early stages of deployment. This guide reviews some ways you can use the client to fetch runs from the server.

Using the `list_runs` method, you can filter runs to analyze and export. Most simple requests can be satisfied using simple top level arguments:

- `project_id` / `project_name`: The project to fetch runs from.
- `run_type`: The type of run to get, such as `llm`, `chain`, `tool`, `retriever`, etc.
- `dataset_name` / `dataset_id`: Fetch runs that are associated with an example row in the specified dataset. This is useful for comparing prompts or models over a given dataset.
- `reference_example_id`: Fetch runs that are associated with a specific example row. This is useful for comparing prompts or models on a given input.
- `parent_run_id` - Fetch runs that are children of a given run. This is useful for fetching [runs grouped together](../../tracing-faq#how-do-i-group-runs-from-multi-turn-interactions) using the context manager or for fetching an agent trajectory.
- `error`: Fetch runs that errored or did not error.
- `run_ids`: Fetch runs with a given list of run ids.
- `filter`: Fetch runs that match a given structured filter statement. See the [run filtering guide](#run-filtering) below for more information.
- `query` (*experimental*): Query the experimental natural language API, which translates your query into a filter statement.

## Using keyword arguments

For simple queries, such as filtering by project, run time, name, or run ID's, you can directly use keyword arguments in the list_runs method. These correspond dirctly to query params in the REST API. All the examples below assume you have created a LangSmith client and configured it with your API key to connect to the LangSmith server.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import Client\n
client = Client()`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { Client, Run } from "langsmith";\n
const client = new Client();`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

Below are some examples of ways to list runs using keyword arguments:

#### List all runs in a project

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`project_runs = client.list_runs(project_name="<your_project>")`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`// Download runs in a project
const projectRuns: Run[] = [];
for await (const run of client.listRuns({
  projectName: "<your_project>",
})) {
  projectRuns.push(run);
};`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

#### List LLM and Chat runs in the last 24 hours

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`todays_llm_runs = client.list_runs(
    project_name="<your_project>",
    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),
    run_type="llm",
)`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`const todaysLlmRuns: Run[] = [];
for await (const run of client.listRuns({
  projectName: "<your_project>",
  startTime: new Date(Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24),
  runType: "llm",
})) {
  todaysLlmRuns.push(run);
};`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

#### List root runs in a project

Root runs, or run traces, are runs that have no parents.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`root_runs = client.list_runs(
    project_name="<your_project>",
    execution_order=1
)`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`const rootRuns: Run[] = [];
for await (const run of client.listRuns({
  projectName: "<your_project>",
  executionOrder: 1,
})) {
  rootRuns.push(run);
};`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

#### List runs without errors

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`correct_runs = client.list_runs(project_name="<your_project>", error=False)`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`const correctRuns: Run[] = [];
for await (const run of client.listRuns({
  projectName: "<your_project>",
  error: false,
})) {
  correctRuns.push(run);
};`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

#### List runs by run ID

If you have a list of run IDs, you can search for them directly using the `id` argumesnt.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`run_ids = ['a36092d2-4ad5-4fb4-9c0d-0dba9a2ed836','9398e6be-964f-4aa4-8ae9-ad78cd4b7074']
selected_runs = client.list_runs(id=run_ids)`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`const runIds = [
  "a36092d2-4ad5-4fb4-9c0d-0dba9a2ed836",
  "9398e6be-964f-4aa4-8ae9-ad78cd4b7074",
];
const selectedRuns: Run[] = [];
for await (const run of client.listRuns({
  id: runIds,
})) {
  selectedRuns.push(run);
};`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

## Run Filtering

Listing runs with query params is useful for simple queries, but doesn't support many common needs, such as filtering by metadata, tags, or other fields.

LangSmith supports a filter query language to permit more complex filtering operations when fetching runs. This guide will provide a high level overview of the grammar as well as a few examples of when it can be useful.

If you'd prefer a more visual guide, you can get a taste of the language by viewing the table of runs on any of your projects' pages. We provide some recommended filters to get you started that you can copy and use the SDK.

### Grammar

The filtering grammar is based on common comparators on fields in the run object. Supported comparators include:

- `gte` (greater than or equal to)
- `gt` (greater than)
- `lte` (less than or equal to)
- `lt` (less than)
- `eq` (equal to)
- `neq` (not equal to)
- `search` (search for a substring in a string field)

Additionally, you can combine multiple comparisons through `and` and `or` operators.

These can be applied on fields of the run object, such as its `id`, `name`, `run_type`, `start_time` / `end_time`, `latency`, `total_tokens`, `error`, `execution_order`, `tags`, and any associated feedback through `feedback_key` and `feedback_score`.

### Examples

The following examples assume you have configured your environment appropriately and have runs stored in LangSmith.
