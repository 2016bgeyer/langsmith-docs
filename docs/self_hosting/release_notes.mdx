# LangSmith Release Notes

:::note
All versions of LangSmith after v0.2 require `langsmith-sdk` version â‰¥ `0.0.71` (Python) and  â‰¥ `0.0.56` (JS/TS) to support changes in pagination of API results.  Older versions will return an http status 405 error.  We strongly encourage use of the latest versions of the SDK for the best performance.

## Week of Februrary 21, 2024 - LangSmith v0.3

LangSmith 0.3 improves performance and reliability, adds improved monitoring charts group by metadata and tag, and adds cost tracking.

### Breaking changes

- This release will drop the postgres run tables - if you are making a migration from LangSmith v0.1 and with to retain run data, you must first update to v0.2 and perform a data migration.  See https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/docs/UPGRADE-0.2.x.md for additional details

### LangSmith UEX Changes

**Tracing** 

- Users can see how much theyâ€™ve spent on LLM calls in their traces and in the monitoring tab.

**Monitoring**

- We now have grouped monitoring charts in LangSmith by metadata and by tag. Read how to set up tags and metadata, and learn about the kinds of visibility this feature unlocks on this [blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/grouped-monitoring-charts/).
- Charts are now available in the testing view, so you can now see how performance changes visually on different iterations of your application.

**Annotation Queues***

-  Weâ€™ve added a structured feedback rubric to help make annotations easier. This feature enables users to create custom feedback keys with predefined categories. The rubric will show up across your LangSmith organization in annotation queues, and feedback will then be validated on submission.

**Playground**

- Support for HuggingFace ðŸ¤—Â models in the Playground. 

### LangSmith SDK Changes

- [Trace sampling](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tracing/tracing-faq#how-do-i-reduce-my-trace-count) has been added to the LangSmith SDK as of python SDK version >= `0.0.84` and JS SDK version >= `0.0.64`.

### Performance and Reliability Changes

- Continued performance when ingesting traces, reducing the delay between ingest and display in the LangSmith UI.

### Admin changes

- None

### Deprecation notices

With the release of 0.3:

- LangSmith 0.2.x and earlier are now in maintenance mode and may only receive critical security fixes.




## Week of January 29, 2024 - LangSmith v0.2

LangSmith 0.2 improves performance and reliability, adds a updated interface for reviewing trace data, and adds support for batch processing of traces.

### Requirements

- This release requires `langsmith-sdk` version â‰¥ `0.0.71` (Python) and  â‰¥ `0.0.56` (JS/TS) to support changes in pagination of API results.  Older versions will return an http status 405 error.

### Breaking changes

- The search syntax for metadata in runs has changed and limits support for nested JSON to a single level.  If you are supplying custom metadata in traces, you should flatten your metadata structure in order to allow it to be searchable, (e.g. `{"user_id": ..., "user_name":...,}`) and then search using `has(metadata, '{"user_name": ...}')`

### LangSmith UEX Changes

**Tracing** 

- We refreshed the run tree so that the most important calls are displayed in the default view with the ability to show all steps in an expanded view.
- Better rendering for tools, function calls, and documents in the trace view and playground.
- Keyboard shortcuts (J, K) to navigate to the previous or next run while in the trace history view.
- Trace histories now have infinite scroll, so you can get more context.
- Trace to playground access for all LLM types.

**Monitoring**

- Drill downs and dynamic stat calculations by tag or metadata on the monitoring tab, so you can filter charts by a segment.

### LangSmith SDK Changes

**LangSmith JS SDK**

- This release adds support for batch ingest of traces and runs to reduce ingest latency and the number of API calls to the Langsmith service.  This feature is currently in pre-release for `langchain` and `langsmith-sdk`.
- Support for `runOverDataset`Â in JSÂ to allow for bulk evaluation of your app over a reference dataset in LangSmith.

### Performance and Reliability Changes

- Improved performance when ingesting traces, reducing the delay between ingest and display in the LangSmith UI.
- Improved performance for updates and deletes on annotation labels.
- Added pagination of API responses.
- Fixed an issue impacting natural language searches.

### Infrastructure Changes

- Added the `clickhouse` database service.  Run results will now be stored in ClickHouse instead of Postgres to improve performance and scalability and reduce delays in the time it takes for runs to appear in LangSmith.
    - Note that if you wish to retain access to run data in the Langsmith UI after updating, a data migration will need to be performed.  Details are available at https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/docs/UPGRADE-0.2.x.md

### Admin changes

- Increased the maximum number of users per organization from 5 to 100 for new organizations.

### Deprecation notices

With the release of 0.2:

- LangSmith 0.1.x is now in maintenance mode and may only receive critical security fixes.
