# LangSmith Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with LangSmith.

## Create an account
To get started with LangSmith, you need to create an account. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://smith.langchain.com).
We support logging in with Google, GitHub, Discord, and email.

## Create an organization
When you log in for the first time, a personal tenant will be created for you automatically. If you'd like to collaborate with others, you can create an organizational and invite your team members to join.

To do this, click on **Person icon** in the bottom left corner of the screen, click **Manage Organizations**, and then click **Create Organization**.
You can currently invite 4 members to your organization for free.
:::note
We'll soon be charging for additional seats and usage. Please see the [pricing page](/pricing) for more information.

## Create an API key
To log traces and run evaluations with LangSmith, you will need to create an API key to authenticate your requests.
Currently, an API key is scoped to a tenant (either Personal or Organizational), so you will need to create an API key for each tenant you want to use.

To create an API key, expand the left sidebar and click on **API Keys**. Then click **Create API Key.**
:::note
The API key will be shown only once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.

## Install the LangSmith library
To use LangSmith in your project, you will need to install the LangSmith library. We currently support Python and JavaScript.

## Log a trace or run an evaluation
Now that you have an API key and the LangSmith library installed, you can start logging traces and running evaluations.
Check out the [tracing quick start](/tracing_new/quick_start) and the [evaluation quick start](/evaluation/quick_start) for more information.
